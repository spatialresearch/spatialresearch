Draft 01 2112282127
> “Technology is changing the way people work. With electronic mail, the internet, teleconferencing, people are starting to ask, ‘What is a headquarters or office environment?’” Art Gensler

> "The future always looks good in the golden land, because no one remembers the past." Joan Didion

* I borrow the title in part from the a16z, The web3 Landscape October 2021 report. It begins curiously as a 'belief' that the future of innovation is built on newer sectors of the economy and with the assistance of decentralized technology. Andreessen Horowitz reports aren't canonical architectural or spatial design texts but oddly this reads like urban planning, land report where different land classifications are discussed. There are seven parts, layers to look at the condition which is a newer technology type. The sections I am interested in are the closing chapters of creator economies and blockchain-based games. Thus the visual part. The #visualweb3 incorporates the spatial, thinking the emergent virtual landscape, an extension of the existing discourses on the physical. As early notes, this text develops a possible stage for thinking out a theory for the metaverse. The last significant architectural theory formulation is from the early 2000s which proposed dismantling architectural aesthetic principles. Deconstruction complemented minimalism back then. Digital and green architecture soon followed. Architecture was very much an object that builds on the building styles discourse. Everything that follows conservation, urbanism, vernacular architecture, housing, landscape architecture, urban planning, campus planning, rural design makes architecture that is building-centric to a building in space, in context. Imaginations of architectural theory no longer became about the building alone but all possible influences shaping its form. Spatial knowledge construction changes significantly as a result of this. With blockchain technology making digital assets non-fungible, real-life ownership patterns are replicable. Transactions of virtual space show potential in rethinking what global architectural theory and criticism can take from in the metaverse. It is merely a proposition to transpose architectural thought as commodities transacted. Theoretical architecture, up till now has retained its form to print, this now is reconsidered. 
* For now, these are 100ish links to get started with spatial and visual cultures of web3.

* Spring of 2021, with the success of NFT's at the art auctions, and subsequent popularity of marketplaces like OpenSea, capital finds a new investment plane. Architecture has always existed as a virtual profession, with its imagination restricted by how it is drawn, technology adopted and therefore built. In some way, it keeps building on a domain framework developed during the Renaissance. Architectural knowledge is never manifested but only represented and developed in time. Co-ordinating real-world construction projects follows a process, that architectural services cater to. As a profession, it assists in the manifestation of spatial assets. The link set tries to outline a system that creates knowledge on the semantic web. 2017 is when the conversations start stemming from the hype around the Ethereum blockchain. '18 & '19 maintain a steady 2017 pace and in 2020 the chatter picks up steam. Though there is no over-arching impact since most of the technology is still developing, it is pertinent to address this emergent landscape to excavate possibilities it could present for spatial design. 2000 - '01 was almost like this with HTML, but it was a different time then. I present the categories within a structure that broadly falls under theory, market, and culture. The theory is 01 to 04. Gathers what are the ideas to outline, limit the landscape which is web3 - what is the metaverse? The next lot 05 to 08, market is where the transactions play out - what are the extents of spatial interventions on the semantic web? I would cite it as a dance, it is messy. Culture after 09 to 13 is the froth that adds a perspective to look at everything or different sections of the marketplace - what do case studies indicate futures of the technology are? Theory makes the market, which in turn creates culture. Creativity in the time of social media has got a refresh with NFTs. It’s not gotten better but has shown a direction to alternative possibilities. Spatial discourse in essence rides along. Material to build in web3 is available and open access. 
* This incentivizes porting spatial development strategies onto this emergent landscape to experiment with.
