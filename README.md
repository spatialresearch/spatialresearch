Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### 2000 - 2010 was #shoppingtheatre. The early stages of locating architectural research. After that publishing anxieties led to the creation of machimach.com on December 25th, 2010. Knowledge construction was the predominant preoccupation of the phase. 2020 the domain died an unfortunate unplanned covid death. spatialresearch.net is born out of necessity to keep a conversation going, this time around building ideas towards a theory on architectural imagination. Documenting a past as an aid to guide the future is the present trajectory of work. The internet creative economy is more fluid and a constantly evolving landscape to participate in. In this context of time and work previously done, the pertinent question to address is what is the state of domain knowledge in architecture how has its form transformed in the immediate past. GitHub is a peculiar choice for thinking spatial practice research, whose standard is images on portfolio cms. The argument proposed is code sits somewhere between completely written text and an image drawn. If this intersection is probed then newer possibilities could emerge from the discourse. Spatial thinking is training that operates within a set of known limits. Displacing that by relocating it within a non-standard environment could create newer possibilities of addressing spatial problems. Can thinking algorithmically or mathematically or statistically change spatial imagination. It is a 10year plan. Work here began with Christopher Alexanderâ€™s Notes on the Synthesis of Form and Pattern Language. Building from this foundation is the now planned trajectory.
