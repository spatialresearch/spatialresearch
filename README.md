Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### spatialresearch.net began as machimach.com on December 25th 2010. 10years after in 2020 machimach.com died a covid death. The event presented an opportunity to reimagine trajectories of architectural research practice, the knowledge it produces, and its form on the internet creative economy. In the time of climate change rather than building more what are the possible contributions to architectural knowledge is the research question, the practice attempts to answer. The practice as its premise draws foundational references to define a writing practice and locate a grand theory on architectural imagination concentrating on spatial theories from the Indian subcontinent. As an extended project, for now, spanning 10years it studies what a previous 20years of work has been and the possibility of alternate forms for an imminent future. I could like to pause here to state this version of the text is a draft and is a record of aspirations of the moment. The project is at an alpha stage whose scope is to stage a set of limits outlined last year and try and consolidate it.
