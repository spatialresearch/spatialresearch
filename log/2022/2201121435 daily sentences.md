* time and its relation to productivity
* The main problem with daily notes, are that it is only looked at and addressed as daily notes.
Thinking in weekly, monthly, or annual notes aren't possible.
Its possible, its not very feasible to think review I would argue in any of the markdown note-taking apps.
The construct is plausible.
You tag or create links to ideas which then collect together. 
Instead of OS managing different files you have a markdown file manager.
As with different native software (its mandatory to use that work for historical references) that creates various files in folders, you have extensions that made possible various ways to work with markdown files.
You can throw in a ton of junk into an OS even if its chrome, it will still work.
Productivity in markdown and only within an interface is not recommended.
Using markdown tools to get work done can move thinking from and in platforms where actual work should happen.
Time is required to understand progress, study events and why they have happened in a certain way.
Being able to wield it is the starting point to think about productivity as a knowledge producing construct.
It is appropriate to state that productivity in management is different from productivity in knowledge work.
Therefore if things are done on time then it has or requires other types of resources than productivity for knowledge work.
Once time is identified, then scales of time comes next to build on a #toolforthought for research work.
The problem that assembles most note-taking systems is that they are all personal systems that cater to personal aspirations and anxieties of knowledge work.
This makes it highly non-adaptable but somehow they end up having cult followings.
There is also a difference between processes and systems, that the research hasn't looked into yet.
To add all research work now can locate within time to address knowledge creation within that time-frame.
So work done like in conversations are all limited within time frames. 
Time can toggle as an invisible grid depending on a perspective it is observed from.
