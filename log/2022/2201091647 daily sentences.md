* #productivitypatterns origin story and tentative plan

Has had three versions.
It started as #roamlearning in RoamResearch.
Roam said it would solve all the productivity problems and could make writing easier. 
I had to try it out. 
Roam makes everyday important. 
Every block is either a second or an hour. 
It is very fun to use everyday.
Everyday is fine but it is possible to soon loose track of a previous month if you don't review it.
Using of Roam well depends quite a bit on how well you know about the various #productivitypatterns around.
So after a point its not very possible to use Roam for a project.
Things get tricky when there are other working projects that are again also lists.
Yes it is possible to get something done in roam but it is like using Paint instead of Photoshop.
Pinterest is for collectors.
You can gather at scale and sort.
But the pictures only a few get and some places it is not very possible to edit pins captured.
It works only if you want to see image collections.
It good to point out that notes are note quite meant to think out grand theories all the time, therefore mega-linked notes is not for everyone.
The point is get back to what you have gathered as habit and make something out of it.
Habit only makes sense if it makes something.
On GitHub there are so many ways to think about the content collected.
Adding dates to cells would help too.
Again to doggedly log times of activity is an underdeveloped habit.
If you want to think linearly then its very possible to use links in Roam. 
#productivitypatterns is a three part problem.
The first is to solve the list as a construct.
Then is sorting and the finding of the patterns.
After that comes the assembling all of that into a wiki.
