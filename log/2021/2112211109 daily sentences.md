* a hope of getting back on track
* I am writing this as a progressive ramble. Sentences as thought has taken a significant blow in schedule and needs urgent fixing. The workflow must be fixed. Sentences on substack worked quite well that getting it on track is necessary to find momentum. There is no method as of now to refer back to what was written previously, while writing a days sentences. Thoughts are meant to be operate on its own. As a mental jog. Ideally it takes only 20minutes to randomly fill up 300words. The last consistent effort was two months back. How to meet everyday's quota is now the trick to solve. What are the necessary sources of inspiration to output a set words consistently is the problem to solve. Earlier I was under the contention it was the tool which made a certain type of output possible. Now I would cite it as bad time management. Or I don't know. Daily drawings has also suffered. Writing is more stressful than thinking. I shouldn't take a break here but mentally there are so many distractions that I have to stop at whatever the word count is now. When text is read, an author's slacking time is not recorded. Several snippets like this I find iteratively a part of this project. The days I missed will be plugged over time, but to methodologically put everything together is tricky with this very large gap in-between. Right now I am back to some text runs on getting these out. There is also Google doc template, just for the logs. Uploading these .md files directly is a way but editing the text is also a pev. The objective is simple production. To prevent distractions and make that output possible is the ends to this task. Finish introductions, backup svbtle and medium, then get to the daily notes.
